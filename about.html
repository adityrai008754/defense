        <h3>Historical Background</h3>
        <p>A Military Department was created in the Supreme Government of the East India Company at Kolkata into the
            year 1776, having the main function to sift and record orders relating to the Army issued by various
            Departments of the Govt of East India Co. The Military Department initially functioned as a branch of the
            Public Department and maintained a list of Army personnel.<br>

            With the Charter Act of 1833 the Secretariat of the Government of East India Company was reorganised into
            four Departments, including a Military Department, each headed by a Secretary to the Government.The Army in
            the Presidencies of Bengal, Bombay & Madras functioned as respective Presidency Army till April 1895, when
            the Presidency Armies were unified into a single Indian Army. For administrative convenience, it was divided
            into four Commands viz. Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras (including Burma) and
            Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).<br>

            The supreme authority over the Indian Army vested in the Governor General-in-Council, subject to the Control
            of the Crown, which was exercised by the Secretary of State for India.Two Members in the Council were
            responsible for military affairs, one of whom was the Military Member, who supervised all administrative and
            financial matters, while the other was the Commander-in-Chief who was responsible for all operational
            matters. The Military Department was abolished in March 1906 and it was replaced by two separate
            Departments, the Army Department and the Military Supply Department. In April 1909 the Military Supply
            Department was abolished and its functions were taken over by the Army Department.The Army Department was
            redesignated as the Defence Department in January 1938. The Department of Defence became the Ministry of
            Defence under a Cabinet Minister in August 1947.</p>
